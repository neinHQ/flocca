# Flocca — VS Code MCP Client

**The all-in-one MCP dashboard. Connect Jira, GitHub, GitLab, AWS, Azure, GCP, Slack, Teams, Postgres, Sentry, Cypress, Playwright, Pytest, and more to your AI agents in one place.**



Flocca turns your local development editor into a **Unified Control Center** for your entire development toolchain. Instead of managing individual connections or switching contexts, Flocca brings everything together using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

Connect your tools once, and give your favorite AI agents (Copilot, Cursor, etc.) the power to:
*   Read and update **Jira** tickets.
*   Manage **GitHub** repositories and PRs.
*   Manage **AWS/Azure** infrastructure.
*   Run **Appium/Playwright** tests.
*   Query **Postgres** databases.

...all without your API keys ever leaving your machine (thanks to our secure local vault).
