## What is Flocca?

Flocca turns your local development editor into a **Unified Control Center** for your entire development toolchain. Instead of managing individual connections or switching contexts, Flocca brings everything together using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

### Key Features
*   **Unified Dashboard**: Manage Jira, Cloud, and Code from a single view.
*   **MCP-Native**: Built on the open standard Model Context Protocol.
*   **Secure Vault**: Credentials stored in your OS keychain, never on our servers.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Install**: Get Flocca from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=flocca.flocca).
2.  **Open Board**: Click the Flocca icon in the Activity Bar.
3.  **Connect**: Select a service (e.g., GitHub) and authenticate.
4.  **Orchestrate**: Start chatting with your agents or build workflows!
