# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I connect my MCP servers?
Flocca makes it easy to connect your MCP servers directly from VS Code. Simply install the extension, open the Flocca dashboard, and add your server details. Flocca handles the handshake and configuration for you.

## How do I know my MCP servers are connected?
The Flocca dashboard provides a live status indicator for all your connected agents. You can see real-time health checks, letting you verify instantly that your MCP servers are connected and ready to accept requests.

## Can I see all my MCP tools in one place?
Yes. Flocca acts as a unified control center, bringing all your MCP servers, local environments, and cloud tools together in one place. No more switching contexts, manage everything from a single interface.

## Is my data secure?
Absolutely. Flocca runs entirely within your VS Code environment. Your credentials and API keys are stored securely in your local machine's keychain and are never sent to our servers.

## Which AI models do you support?
Flocca is model-agnostic. You can bring your own API keys for OpenAI (GPT-4), Anthropic (Claude), or even connect to local LLMs via Ollama. We give you the flexibility to choose the best brain for your agents.

## Is Flocca free to use?
Flocca offers a generous free tier for individual developers. For teams requiring advanced collaboration features and shared agent configurations, we offer a Pro plan. Check out our pricing section for more details.

## Why choose Enterprise instead of Teams?

## What is the minimum seat count?
Teams starts at 3 seats. Enterprise starts at 10 seats.

## Can we add or remove seats anytime?
You can add seats anytime. Removals and downgrade timing follow the standard billing grace period policy.

## How are additional seats billed?
Additional seats are billed immediately when added using Stripe-supported online payment methods.

## Can one user have multiple SKUs?
Yes. Owner and Admin roles can assign multiple SKUs to a single user based on responsibilities.
