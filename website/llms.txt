# Flocca: Connect MCPs Simply and Securely

## What is Flocca?
Flocca is an IDE-first MCP platform and VS Code extension that connects local environments, cloud infrastructure, and AI agents. Teams use Flocca to connect tools once and run cross-tool workflows from one workspace.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Connect once**: Link Jira, GitHub, cloud, testing, and communication tools from the IDE.
- **MCP-native**: Uses Model Context Protocol so AI agents can act across systems with consistent interfaces.
- **Secure by default**: Credentials are stored in local secure storage with encrypted handling.
- **Team controls**: Role-based access and per-user SKU assignment for connector access.
- **Seat-based scale**: Teams and Enterprise plans with instant top-up billing when seats are added.

## Supported Integrations (MCP Servers)
- **Issue Tracking / PM**: Jira, Confluence, Zephyr, Notion
- **Design / Collaboration**: Figma, Slack, Microsoft Teams
- **Source Control / CI**: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, GitHub Actions
- **Cloud / Infra**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, Docker
- **Data / Observability**: PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Sentry
- **Testing / QA**: Cypress, Playwright, Pytest, TestRail

## How It Works
1. **Connect**: Install the extension and configure connectors from the Flocca dashboard.
2. **Run workflows**: AI agents can operate across tickets, code, tests, and deployments through MCP.
3. **Manage access**: Owners/Admins assign connector SKUs and monitor seat usage.

## Pricing
- **Teams**: $12.99 per seat/month, minimum 3 seats.
- **Enterprise**: $24.99 per seat/month, minimum 10 seats.
- **Seat scaling**: Additional seats can be added anytime and are billed immediately.

## Technical Details
- **Architecture**: IDE extension + MCP connectors + backend APIs.
- **Security**: Local credential handling and encrypted storage practices.
- **Model support**: Works with AI agents that can use MCP toolchains.
- **Compatibility**: Built for VS Code and compatible IDE workflows.
